Course description

Modeling approaches to describe relevant problems in chemical engineering practice and to gain insight in modeling realization by considering chemical engineering  applications and software developments.  In this course, the modeling mathematical topics relevant to chemical engineering will be used to model relevant complex chemical problems.  Topics include systems based fundamental and empirical modelling, first principle models, continuous and discrete modeling, model representation, model properites, data driven models (fitting & regression analysis). The course will provide the insight in basic cooding (python) and will illustrate all sections with appropriate numerical problems.
